            Dr. Martin Luther King, a black American, was bom In 1929 in Atlanta. Although slavery was abolished in the USA in 1862, some white people in the USA were still discriminating against the blacks. The blacks had to suffer humiliation at every step. Martin Luther opposed this strongly. He travelled throughout the United States of America and abroad, lecturing and meeting civil and religious leaders. He wanted to complete the unfinished work of Abraham Lincoln. He followed the path of non-violence shown by Mahatma Gandhi. He became the leader of black Americans. The blacks started a peaceful movement to be treated as equals of the whites. His movement became very popular. In 1964 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He, too, was assassinated like Mahatma Gandhi. He was not even 40 years old at that time.
